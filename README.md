a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

This is my sails 'stack'.

It is based on Ryan Quinns sails repo https://github.com/ryanwilliamquinn/sails-permissions-example and article  http://threeninetyfive.net/blog/2015/07/14/sails-permissions-by-example/

I have modified it to use SASS, Jade and winston for file logging.

There should be a blog post regarding this at http://gofwd.co.za/hoisting-the-main-sail/
